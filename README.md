# racial_discrimination_analysis
Perform statistical analysis to establish whether race has a significant impact on the rate of callbacks for resumes

1. What test is appropriate for this problem? Does CLT apply?
2. What are the null and alternate hypotheses?
3. Compute margin of error, confidence interval, and p-value.
4. Write a story describing the statistical significance in the context or the original problem.
5. Does your analysis mean that race/name is the most important factor in callback success? Why or why not? If not, how would you amend your analysis?
